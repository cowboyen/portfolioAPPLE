                        A UX and UI redesign for Iceland's tourist bus interface through TRY Dig AS, transforming the navigation system with 
                        real-time tracking implementation, a design system for consistency and smoother hand-off and enhanced visual hierarchy for improved user experience.

                    <p class="context-description">
                        The existing tourist bus interface faced two critical issues. First, poor visual hierarchy where all elements – buses, stops, and routes – shared the 
                        same red color, making navigation difficult. Second, a problematic time display system where waiting times were based on fixed schedule points rather 
                        than actual bus location. For example, if a bus was scheduled for 14:15, the system would show "9 minutes" at 14:06, regardless of the bus's actual 
                        position. This rigid schedule-based approach, rather than real-time tracking, led to significant user frustration and confusion.

                    <div class="context-title">Discovery and analysis</div>
                    <p class="context-description">
                        The initial phase involved analyzing the existing color system and user pain points. User feedback identified that the monochromatic 
                        red scheme was causing significant confusion, particularly when users tried to distinguish between buses and stops on the map.

                <div class="context-section">
                    <div class="context-title">Design system development</div>
                    <p class="context-description">
                        The new design system focused on clear visual hierarchy and component reusability. Key elements included:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Buttons and links:</b> The design system implements buttons and links with consistent sizing and hierarchy. Buttons come in three sizes (small, base, large) and three style variants: primary (light blue), secondary (navy), and outline. Each button can include a trailing icon to enhance visual feedback and indicate actions. The layout accommodates both standalone and full-width implementations to maintain flexibility across different contexts.
                                <br>
                                Links are categorized as either stand-alone or in-line, with primary, secondary, and disabled states. Each variant includes a subtle directional arrow to indicate external navigation or actions. For improved accessibility and user experience, anchor links utilize a downward arrow icon to clearly indicate scroll-to-section functionality. The system maintains consistent hover states and focus indicators across all interactive elements, ensuring both aesthetic coherence and functional clarity.
                                
                                
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Map component states:</b> The map interface was designed with various zoom states, ensuring information remained clear and useful at 
                                each level. This involved careful consideration of how different elements (buses, stops, routes) would scale and interact.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Semantic elements:</b>The design system implements a hierarchy of semantic alert elements to communicate different 
                                types of events. The Error component is used for critical situations such as closed bus stops. The warning component 
                                alerts about challenges like icy conditions, while the info component conveys general information such as accessibility or 
                                temporary changes. This semantic framework supports both global events and notifications tied to individual stops, ensuring 
                                consistent and clear communication to the users about the service.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Icon redesign:</b> The bus and bus stop icons were completely redesignet to create clear visual distinction. Each icon was designed to 
                                work across different sizes while maintaining visibility and purpose.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p class="context-description">
                        A major improvement was the shift from fixed schedule times to actual real-time tracking. Instead of showing countdown to pre-scheduled arrival times (without including delays).
                        The new interface displays the bus's current location related to the chosen stop. This change directly addressed user feedback 
                        about the misleading nature of the previous system. The implementation required careful consideration of how to display dynamic timing information clearly 
                        while handling real-world variables like traffic delays and service changes. As a result of this, we also had to include semantic components so delays and/or bigger events can be annonced.

                        The redesign demonstrates that focused design decisions can transform user experience. By separating visual elements through color and implementing 
                        real-time tracking, the service became more trustworthy and easier to navigate. These fundamental improvements addressed the core user needs: quick 
                        understanding of bus locations and reliable arrival times.
